# Rapid Control Project: LQG Controller for Helicopter System
## Overview
A project where I modelled, simulated and implemented an advanced multivariable controller for a real-world helicopter system.

## Installation
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed, as well as the  **Control Systems Toolbox, Data Acquisition Toolbox, Data acquisition toolbox support package for National Instruments NI-DAQmx devices, SIMULINK Real-Time Toolbox, Aerospace Blockset.**
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/George-Craft/rapid-control-prototyping-project.git
3. Navigate to the project directory and open the simulation folder (or real-world model if a helicopter system is available), then open both the Simulink model and MATLAB code.
4. Run the MATLAB code first, then the Simulink model.

## Results
Results can be seen inside the project report in the results folder.
